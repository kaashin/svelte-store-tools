# Svelte Store Tools

A simple development utility for Svelte apps that use svelte stores. This tool provides a utility panel to view the contents of a store and debug the contents of the store. 

# Todo
- Still not loving the styling
- Add ability to modify the name of a object property
- Change the type of a property

# Random thoughts
- Is there a way to determine how many subscribers there are to a store?
- Is there a way to record history of changes to the store?
- Validation on the form inputs when adding new items to Arrays or Objects
